0. Before making a distribution
-------------------------------

- Run "make test".
- Create a tag vX.Y.Z where "X.Y.Z" is the version.


1. Making Unix distribution
---------------------------

Run "make -C distrib distrib_unix", the output file will be
bakefile-X.Y.Z_beta-bin.tar.bz2.


2. Making Windows distribution
------------------------------

Ensure that you have pyinstaller submodule (which is only needed for making
Windows distributions) and do

       git submodule update --init 3rdparty/pyinstaller

if necessary.

Check that upx and zip are in PATH.

Run "make -C distrib distrib_win", the output file be
bakefile-X.Y.Z_beta-win.zip

Notice that at one time there was an effort to produce an MSI installer for
bakefile and its remains can be found in wix subdirectory, however the files
there are not maintained and bakefile currently is not distributed in this
form.
