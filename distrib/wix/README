This directory contains the files needed to build a Windows installer (MSI)
for bakefile.

Notice that the installer is very much experimental and work in progress.

To use it you need to install WiX (http://wix.sourceforge.net/index.html).
Version 3.5 was used for testing.

Assuming WiX tools are in the path, simply run the following commands to
produce bkl.msi:

	candle bkl.wxs
	light -ext WixUIExtension bkl.wixobj

Then you can do

	msiexec /i bkl.msi

to test installation.
