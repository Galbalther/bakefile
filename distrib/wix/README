This directory contains the files needed to build a Windows installer (MSI)
for bakefile.

Notice that the installer is very much experimental and work in progress.

To use it you need to install WiX (http://wixtoolset.org/).
Version 3.5 or later must be used (because of "MajorUpgrade" use), 3.5.2519.0
was used for testing.

Assuming WiX tools are in the path, simply run the following commands to
produce bkl.msi:

	heat dir ..\..\docs\html\ -srd -ag -sfrag -template fragment -dr DOCSDIR -cg docs -var var.DocSource -out docs.wxs
	candle bkl.wxs
	candle -dDocSource="..\..\docs\html" docs.wxs
	light -ext WixUIExtension bkl.wixobj docs.wixobj -out bkl.msi

Then you can do

	msiexec /i bkl.msi

to test installation.
