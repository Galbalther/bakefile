 Requirements
--------------

Python >= 2.2.2, including builtin XML modules It is highly recommended to
install libxml2-python as well, but it is not required.  (In Debian 3.0, these
are in python2.2, python2.2-dev, python2.2-xmlbase and
libxml2-python2.2 packages.)

 Building Bakefile
-------------------

On Unix or in Unix-like environment, do ./configure && make && make install.
Requirements: installed Python (including headers).

On Windows, either downloaded installer package or compile it by running
nmake -f makefile.vc (you will need MSVC++ 6 and Python installed in directory
specified at the beginning of makefile.vc).


 Building from CVS
-------------------

(Note: this does _not_ apply to downloaded tarballs, only to code fetched
from SourceForge CVS.)
Run autogen.sh script and then proceed as when building from tarball. In order
to run autogen.sh successfully, you need the following packages: SWIG 1.3.x
(http://www.swig.org), Automake >= 1.6, Autoconf >= 2.53, libtool, libxslt
(including xsltproc program) and DocBook XSL stylesheets (last two are for
building HTML documentation).
