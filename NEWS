Version 0.1.2

- fixed bakefile_gen if Bakefile was installed in directory containing
  space in its name
- fixed configure on Mac OS X
- variables and targets are no longer alphabetically sorted in generated
  makefiles, the order of their declaration in bakefiles is now preserved
  (this fixes the bug when output generated using Python 2.2 was different
  from output if using Python 2.3)
