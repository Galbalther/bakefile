Version 0.1.3
-------------

- use mkstemp() to create temporary files if available
- lock output files so that it is possible to run multiple instances of
  bakefile on same tree
- added -j flag to bakefile_gen for simultaneous execution of more bakefile
  instances on multiprocessor systems
- msvc6prj: don't output external dependencies as first projects in workspace


Version 0.1.2
-------------

- fixed bakefile_gen if Bakefile was installed in directory containing
  space in its name
- fixed configure on Mac OS X
- variables and targets are no longer alphabetically sorted in generated
  makefiles, the order of their declaration in bakefiles is now preserved
  (this fixes the bug when output generated using Python 2.2 was different
  from output if using Python 2.3)


Version 0.1.1
-------------

- first public release
