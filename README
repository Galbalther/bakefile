  1. Using Bakefile
=====================

If you obtained one of the prebuilt packages (MSI or ZIP file for windows or
the -bin.tar.bz2 tarball for Unix and OS X), then you can simply unpack it
somewhere and run the 'bkl' tool in its top directory.

On Windows, you don't need anything else, bkl.exe is self-contained executable.
On other systems, you must have Python (2.6 or newer) installed.

Also see the documentation in the docs/ subdirectory.



  2. Reporting bugs etc.
==========================

Source code repository, bug tracker, wiki:
https://github.com/vslavik/bakefile
https://github.com/vslavik/bakefile/issues
https://github.com/vslavik/bakefile/wiki

Mailing list for discussion of Bakefile issues:
bakefile-devel@lists.sourceforge.net



  3. Building from sources
============================

You'll need the following to compile Bakefile from sources obtained from
the git repository:

1. Python >= 2.6+

2. Sphinx documentation tool. Install it with

       easy_install Sphinx

3. If you want to run the test suite, you'll need py.test too:

       easy_install pytest

Moreover, a recent version of ANTLR 3.4 (newer than the 3.4 release) is
required. You have two options:

(a) If you are using a git checkout, then you just need to checkout the submodules:

       git submodule init
       git submodule update

    Up-to-date version of ANTLR is included as a submodule and the makefile
    takes care of using it.

    JDK and Maven must be installed for this.

(b) Alternatively, you can install ANLTR and its Python runtime system-wide:

    4. ANTLR 3.4 generator. Because of bugs in the official release, a git
       version is needed for now. You can download prebuilt binary from
       https://github.com/downloads/vslavik/bakefile/antlr-3.4-complete.jar (the
       sources are available from the official ANTLR repository at
       https://github.com/antlr/antlr3). It has to be available at the `PATH`
       under the `antlr-3.4` name, e.g. using the following shell script:

           #!/bin/sh
           java -jar /path/to/antlr-3.4-complete.jar "$@"

    5. ANTLR 3.4 Python runtime (no patches needed). It can be installed with
       `easy_install`:

           easy_install https://github.com/downloads/vslavik/bakefile/antlr_python_runtime-3.4.tar.gz

Once all tools are installed, you can build Bakefile by running `make`. This
generates the parser from ANTLR grammar and build the HTML documentation.
