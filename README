Building from sources
---------------------

You'll need the following to get Bakefile running:

1. Python >= 2.6+

2. ANTLR 3.4 generator. Because of bugs in the official release, a patched
   version is needed for now. You can download prebuilt binary from
   https://github.com/downloads/vslavik/antlr/antlr-3.4-complete.jar
   (the sources are available at https://github.com/vslavik/antlr). It has
   to be available at the `PATH` under the `antlr-3.4` name, e.g. using the
   following shell script:

       #!/bin/sh
       java -jar /path/to/antlr-3.4-complete.jar "$@"

3. ANTLR 3.4 Python runtime (no patches needed). It can be installed with
   `easy_install`:

       easy_install https://github.com/downloads/vslavik/antlr/antlr_python_runtime-3.4.tar.gz

4. Sphinx documentation tool. Install it with

       easy_install Sphinx

Once all tools are installed, you can build Bakefile by running `make`. This
generates the parser from ANTLR grammar and build the HTML documentation. Use
the `./bkl` script to run Bakefile.
